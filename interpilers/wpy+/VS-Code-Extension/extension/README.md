# Python+ Language Support

This is a minimal VS Code extension skeleton for Python+ (.pyp) files. It provides simple keyword completions and a hover for `pyppstdio`.

How to run

1. Open this folder in VS Code (the folder containing `package.json`).
2. Press F5 to launch the Extension Development Host and open a test window.
3. Create a file with extension `.pyp` and try completions (Ctrl+Space) or hover over `pyppstdio`.

Notes

- This is intentionally minimal. For full language features, consider adding a language server or TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting.
